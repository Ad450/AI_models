Governments around the world have set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, prompting a surge in investment in solar, wind, and hydropower technologies. Advances in battery storage and smart grid systems have also helped address one of the biggest challenges of renewable energy â€” intermittency.\n",
        "In 2022 alone, global renewable capacity grew by more than 10%, led primarily by new installations in Asia and Europe. The cost of producing electricity from solar and wind has fallen by over 80% since 2010, making these sources more affordable than fossil fuels in many regions. Major corporations have joined the movement, with companies like Google and Apple operating entirely on renewable power.\n",
        "However, the transition has not been without challenges. Developing nations still struggle with infrastructure limitations, while energy storage remains a bottleneck for consistent supply. Additionally, the mining of rare earth elements required for battery production has raised environmental and ethical concerns. Despite these hurdles, experts believe that with continued innovation and international cooperation, renewable energy will play a dominant role in the global power mix by 2040.\"\"\"\n",
